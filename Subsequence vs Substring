The difference between them, can cearly be made out from the following readings:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring


The ALGORITHMS for finding both are also DIFFERENT:
1. For Subsequnece:
  We use the traditional LCS algorithm
2. For Substring:
  We use,
        1. KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) algorithm

        2. Rabin-Karp algorithm

	In actual understanding, subsequence and substring are DIFFERENT.
	However Java developers implemented these two methods to return the same output.
	For Example:
	(Example Source: http://mytactics.blogspot.com/2013/10/difference-between-subsequence-and.html)
	class StringSeqSub{
    public static void main(String args[])
    	{
        String str = "Hello World.!!";
        // String s1 = str.subSequence(0, 5);    // this line will throw error
        CharSequence s1 = str.subSequence(0, 5);
        String s2 = str.substring(0, 5);
        System.out.println(s1);
        System.out.println(s2);
    	} 
	}
Output - 
Hello
Hello
